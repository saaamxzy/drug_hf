2. Format problem, the drug is not in some certain words. All drug names in the document is also not okay

1. Fix the first two simple drug quantities but the results aren't improved.
2. Try a simple way to deal with the multiple defendants cases, but the results aren't improved.
=> Try more complicated methods
3. Add the minority of the def
4. Add drug quantity is a little complex => do it later
5. predict the results as excel files for the xj province: data/xinjiang_drug_predicted_2017.csv
6. Analyze the original and new cases of xj
    original file num (xj):  1479
    new file num (xj):  1535
    matched file num (xj):  1310
7. predict the results as excel files for all the provinces: there are so many special cases that I need to tackle.
I focus on the three samples, yn, gd, all first and the results are in provinces/.
=> Extend to all provinces with some critical analysis.
