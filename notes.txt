Heng ji: Open IE for low resource languages
Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, as- sign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an En- glish Knowledge Base (KB) if it is link- able.


1. Judge Characteristics:
judge.name
judge.ethnicity (not given; use name length and common Han names to define whether a judge is an ethnic minority)

2. Defendant Characteristics: 
def.name
def.name.prev
def.ethnicity (some are marked in the cases; others need to be inferred) # low precision is because of the no annotation
def.recid      (whether the defendant is a recidivist)
def.goodattitude

3. Nature of the Crime:
drug name
drug quantity (we can focus on “净重"; we also want to grab multiple numbers if there are more than one type of drugs involved)

4. Punishments:
pun.fiximpris.length (有期徒刑; record numbers of months sentenced)
pun.lifeimpris           (0/1 if received life imprisonment) 
pun.death                (0/1 if received death penalty) 


1.  drug.heroin.quantity and  drug.meth.quantity: right now the f1_scores are around 80%. Can we try and see whether we can increase precision there?

2. def.ethnicity:  {'precision': 0.7871643745907008, 'recall': 0.9844389844389845, 'f1_score': 0.8748180494905387}
    I feel here we can get the ethnicity as good as the judge ethnicity (>90%)

3. def.recid
{'precision': 0.8650949574328749, 'recall': 0.8650949574328749, 'f1_score': 0.8650949574328749, 'correct num': 1321, 'pred num': 1527, 'gold num': 1527}

4. def.goodattitude:
{'precision': 0.8500327439423707, 'recall': 0.9848254931714719, 'f1_score': 0.9124780316344465, 'correct num': 1298, 'pred num': 1527, 'gold num': 1318}
